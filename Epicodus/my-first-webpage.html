    <p>The 'a' tag is really important here. It builds links from this page to another page, which could be inside this folder/directory/site/server, or to another site sits somewhere on the Internet. Be sure to include either 'http://' or 'https://' in that case. Or the browser will try to find it from the folder of current page, which is obviously wouldn't find anything here, and therefore return an error message. On the other hand, if you want to link index page to about page and all the other pages inside your site, 'a' tag is the way to put them together, so that you got hyperlink and get them working together to form a site.  </p>
    <p>Another thing here is inline style used, be it 'em' or 'strong' or 'a' tag. </p>
    <img src="img/CuteKitten.jpg" alt="Cute Kitten: Thinking or Praying?"><br />
    <p>I didn't really used image or photo before, so above is an example. Well, added a new folder called 'img', then moved the picture into that folder, and changed the src to reflect the source change. Keep alt as same, and it won't be shown if the picture works anyway. BTW, I added an image into the list item, that could further add 'a' tag for hyperlink into the same 'li' tag as well, but I didn't. Also, google on 'placeholder image' will give you the site and link for image holder, that would random serve the image with the same size into your page, before you decide which photo to use here and there. A very good service indeed.</p>
