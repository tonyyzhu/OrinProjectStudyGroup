pseudo-class selectors
-----------------------------------

- An unvisited link -- a:link
- A visited link --- a:visited
- A link you hovering your mouse over --- a:hover
- first child paragraph -- p:first-child {}
- nth child paragraph -- p:nth-child(n) {}     || Please note that 'n' is counted from its parents level.

- 'border-radius' is used for round corner of a block/button. But, 'border-radius: 100%;' would be a cycle.
- 'border: 2px solid red'  -- only with border statement it will show up on screen. Without this one, you can define a border but not visible.
