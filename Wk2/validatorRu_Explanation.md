/*               15/7/2014               Grab html5.validator.nu website simple interface page

Only three files that formed the working application:
1. validatorRU.html
2. script.js
3. style.css

On top of that, the 'About this Service' refer to its manual pages that have much more pages for explanation. I don't need them at the moment.
'More Options' link lead to another web page that has more forms, but use the same underline JavaScript program file for checking application.
I don't need at the moment.

It is amazing that I can use just Firefox &. firebug to grab the whole source code of this simple application. It is open-source so the author doesn't care.
But, for commercial web application, what would happen? Using PHP or Ruby on Rails do something to hide 'real application' away?

I need to go through this web application as part of my learning experience for Front End, hopefully complete this week. (Next week the most!)
