    <h1>HTML Intermediate Tutorial</h1>

    <h3>Span and Div: with attributes of class and is, used for CSS selectors</h3>
    <p>'span' element is <b>in-line</b> and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line, such as inside a paragraph. </p>
    <p>'div' or division is <b>block-line</b>(like having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code. </p>
    <p>HTML5 has more tags for grouping and also adding meaning at same time, for those blocks that used to have to be done in 'div' tag: 'article', 'header', 'footer', and more. </p>

    <h3>Text: Abbreviations, Quotations, and Code</h3>
    <p>This web site is about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The expended phrase that the abbreviation is optional but recommended.</p>
    <p>So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know as much about quotations as I do about pigeon fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
        <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.</p>
        <p>Blockquotes work very nicely with the HTML5 elements 'figure' and 'figcaption', enabling a nice, semantic way to group a quotation with a citation. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <figure>
        <blockquote>[Big old quotation about evolution]</blockquote>
        <figcaption>Charles Darwin</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Citations: HTML5 not only has 'cite' attribute (such as in 'blockquote' tag), but also has a 'cite' tag, that can be used to define the title of a work(such as a book).  </p>
    <p>According to <cite>the Bible</cite>, after six days God said <q>screw this for a lark, I'm having a nap</q>.</p>
    <p>'code' is used to represent any form of computer code. Further, 'var' can be used for variables (which could be a variable in anything, not just in code - it could be a variable in an equation, for example), 'samp' for sample output, and 'kbd' (keyboard) for user input.</p>
    <p>If you add the line <code><var>givevaderachuckle</var> = true;</code> to the <code>destroy_planet</code> subroutine and then type <kbd>ilovejabba</kbd> into the console, the big bad green Death Star laser will etch <samp>Slug Lover!</samp> on the planet's surface.</p>
    <p>'pre' is preformatted text and is unusual in HTML tags that it takes notice of every character in it, including the white space (whereas other elements will ignore a consecutive space or a line-break, for example). It is most commonly used for blocks of code, where spacing, such as indentations, can be relevant.</p>
    <pre><code>
    &lt;div id="intro"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Some heading&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some paragraph paragraph thing thing thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
