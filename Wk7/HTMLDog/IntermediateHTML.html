    <h1>HTML Intermediate Tutorial</h1>

    <h3>Span and Div: with attributes of class and is, used for CSS selectors</h3>
    <p>'span' element is <b>in-line</b> and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line, such as inside a paragraph. </p>
    <p>'div' or division is <b>block-line</b>(like having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code. </p>
    <p>HTML5 has more tags for grouping and also adding meaning at same time, for those blocks that used to have to be done in 'div' tag: 'article', 'header', 'footer', and more. </p>

    <h3>Text: Abbreviations, Quotations, and Code</h3>
    <p>This web site is about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The expended phrase that the abbreviation is optional but recommended.</p>
    <p>So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know as much about quotations as I do about pigeon fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
        <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.</p>
        <p>Blockquotes work very nicely with the HTML5 elements 'figure' and 'figcaption', enabling a nice, semantic way to group a quotation with a citation. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <figure>
        <blockquote>[Big old quotation about evolution]</blockquote>
        <figcaption>Charles Darwin</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Citations: HTML5 not only has 'cite' attribute (such as in 'blockquote' tag), but also has a 'cite' tag, that can be used to define the title of a work(such as a book).  </p>
    <p>According to <cite>the Bible</cite>, after six days God said <q>screw this for a lark, I'm having a nap</q>.</p>
    <p>'code' is used to represent any form of computer code. Further, 'var' can be used for variables (which could be a variable in anything, not just in code - it could be a variable in an equation, for example), 'samp' for sample output, and 'kbd' (keyboard) for user input.</p>
    <p>If you add the line <code><var>givevaderachuckle</var> = true;</code> to the <code>destroy_planet</code> subroutine and then type <kbd>ilovejabba</kbd> into the console, the big bad green Death Star laser will etch <samp>Slug Lover!</samp> on the planet's surface.</p>
    <p>'pre' is preformatted text and is unusual in HTML tags that it takes notice of every character in it, including the white space (whereas other elements will ignore a consecutive space or a line-break, for example). It is most commonly used for blocks of code, where spacing, such as indentations, can be relevant.</p>
    <pre><code>
    &lt;div id="intro"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Some heading&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some paragraph paragraph thing thing thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Meta Tags</h3>
    <p>Meta tags don't do anything except for search engine indexing. Its attributes such as 'keywords' and 'description' is often used by search engines to display a description of a web page in its search results. 'keywords' meta data was used (and abused) extensively, that nowadays Google rely on the actual content of the page itself.  Below is an example: </p>

    <pre><code> 
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Air conditioners? YEAH conditioners!&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3"&gt;&lt;!--not recommended for sane people--&gt;
        &lt;meta name="description" content="This is my really, really, REALLY exciting web page about air conditioners"&gt;
        ...
    </code></pre>


    <h3>'colspan' & 'rowspan': merge columns or rows together in 'td' (data cells). </h3>

    <h3>Definition List: a list of terms and descriptions(such as a glossary) </h3>
    <p>Its elements are more like table elements: 'dl' for Definition List (like 'ol' or 'ul'); 'dt' for Definition Terms (like 'th' for table header); 'dd' for Definition Descriptions (like 'td' for table data cells). Below is an example: </p>

    <h4>Some random glossary thing</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>Abbreviation for HyperTestMarkup Language - a language used to make web pages.</dd>

        <dt>Dog</dt>
        <dd>Any carnviorous animal belonging to the family Canidae.</dd>
        <dd>The domesticated sub-species of the family Canidae, Canis lupus familiaris.</dd>

        <dt>Moo juice</dt>
        <dt>Cat beer</dt>
        <dt>Milk</dt>
        <dd>A white liquid produced by cows and used for human consumption.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>More obscure tags: Address, Definition, Bi-directional, Editorial</h3>
    <p>They are helpful but much narrower applied field, hense you won't see them around very often. Below are the examples.</p>

    <h4>Author contact Details</h4>
    <address>
        <ul>
            <li>0123-456-7890</li>
            <li>author_dude@noplaceinteresting.com</li>
            <li>http://www.noplaceinteresting.com/contactme/</li>
        </ul>
    </address>

    <p>'dfn' is a <strong>definition</strong> term and is used to highlight the first use of a term. Like 'abbr', the 'title' attribute can be used to describe the term. Example below: </p>
    <p>Bob's <dfn title="Dog">canine</dfn> mother and <dfn title="Horse">equine</dfn> father sat him down and carefully explained that he was an <dfn title="A mutation that combines two or more sets of chromosomes from different species">allopolypoid</dfn> organism. </p>

    <p>'bdo' can be used to reverse the direction of the text, and can be used to display languages that read right to left. The value of the required attribute 'dir' can be 'ltr'(left to right) or 'rtl'(right to left). Below is an example:</p>
    <bdo dir="rtl">god lmth</bdo>

    <p>'ins' and 'del' are used to display editorial insertions and deletions respectively, just like "Track Changes" feature in word processors. It can be used on swathes of content instead of just a few text/words. </p>
    <p>I have decided to <del datetime="2013-01-26">decrease</del> <ins cite="http://www.icecreamforall.com/changeofpolicy/">increase</ins> the amount of free ice cream that the State will provide for its citizens.</p>

    <h3>Sectioning using a number of tags to provide a cleaner, clearer semantic structure</h3>

    <p>'article' element can be used to make up a <strong>standalone section</strong> of content. 'section' element represents a more <strong>general section</strong> and could be used to split up an article, or to represent chapters, for example. It used to be 'div' for these separations and/or styling, but these tags would provide a much richer and more meaningful document. </p>

    <article>
        <section id="intro">
            <p>[An introduction] </p>
        </section>
        <section id="main_content">
            <p>[Content] </p>
        </section>
        <section id="related">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="that.html">That related article</a></li>
                <li><a href="this.html">This related article</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </article>

    <p>'header' and 'footer' provide further specialized and self-descriptive sections. In below articles, the first 'footer' is the footer of the article and the second 'footer' is the footer of the page. </p>

    <article>
        <header>
            <h1>Alternatively&hellip;</h1>
            <p>[An introduction] </p>
        </header>
        <section id="main_content">
            <p>[Content] </p>
        </section>
        <footer>
            <p>[End notes] </p>
        </footer>
    </article>
    <footer>
        <p>[Copyright bumf] </p>
    </footer>

    <p>'aside' is more like a pull-quotes or snippets of related information in an article: </p>
    <section id="main_content">
        <h1>Tixall</h1>
        <p>[All about Tixall] </p>
        <aside>
            <h2>Tixall obelisk</h2>
            <p>[A short note about Tixall obelisk] </p>
        </aside>
        <p>[Maybe a bit more about Tixall] </p>
    </section>
    <figure>
        <img src="obelisk.jpg">
        <figcaption>Tixall Obelisk</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>'nav' is used to mark up a group of <strong>navigation links</strong>. </p>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/tutorials/">Tutorials</a></li>
            <li><a href="/reference/">Reference</a></li>
            <li><a href="/articles/">Articles</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about/">About us</a></li>
            <li><a href="#overthere">In-Page Navigation for major groupings. (copyright, author, sidebar, footer, etc.) </a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <p>BTW, IE8 or earlier versions don't understand these tags, although it is much nicer than old &lt;div id="#"&gt; elements. In these case, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv">HTML5Shiv</a> can be your rescue. Or, you could stay with safe old but semantically poorer headings and divs approach. </p>
