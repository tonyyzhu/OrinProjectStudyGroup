Core Concepts:
Scripting Language that only works inside a Web Browser.
    It runs inside a web page, which is inside Web Browser, which is inside OS.
    If user disable JavaScript inside a browser, it will be sent to the browser but won't be executed.
It can't access local files (file system), hardware(or USB etc), or database via direct access.
It is a client-side language, that is pushed from server to end-user's Web Browser and then running there.
Program runs on the server is called Server-side language, or Back-end language, like PHP, RoR, ASP.Net etc.
It now also runs in Application side such as Adobe Acrobat or PhotoShop, or Server-side such as Node.js or Google Apps Script.

History:
It was developed in 1995 called LiveScript, then renamed as JavaScript in 1996 (implemented inside NetScape2).
IE3 did JScript (M$ version). In 1997, Netscape submitted it to ECMA and becomes ECMAScript as standard.
1999 EcMAScript 3 published has been universally supported, and becomes the web standard everyone uses even now.
2009 ECMAScript 5 published but still not fully supported by various browsers, and still backwards compatible with 3.
But People always call it JavaScript instead of ECMAScript.

Tools:
Just Text Editor is enough; such as  Sublime Text Editor I am using.
Aptana Studio 3.4 recommended and installed by me, but has TouchPad Right Botton issue appear and disappear.
It is free and available on all kind of platforms. Including debug feature, Git feature, and Publish to Web Server feature.
Also installed Firebug to latest Firefox Browser, as one of two major tools used here, for debuging and stepping tools.
It also can allow user to directly execute JavaScript programs without using a web page. (Enable Console Panel &. Command Editor Panel)
